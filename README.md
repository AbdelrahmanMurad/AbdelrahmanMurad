Aspiring Quality Assurance Engineer with a solid background in Backend Development. Skilled in Manual, API, Database, Automation, and Mobile Testing. Experienced in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java, and familiar with frameworks like Node.js and NestJS. Currently sharpening my QA skills through hands on training with AXSOS Academy.

Graduated with a bachelor's degree in software development from the Islamic University of Gaza, where I focused on coding, data structures, and system architecture. This technical background has strengthened my ability to analyze applications from both a user and developer perspective making me more effective in identifying bugs, designing test cases, and understanding system behavior. My core focus is Quality Assurance, and I'm dedicated to growing in this field, applying both manual and automated testing practices to help deliver high quality, reliable software.
